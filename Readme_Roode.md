# Readme

I added my name to keep this from conflicting with the one Robert is working on.

## Folder overview:

/build: reserved for the build output.
/deps: this folder is for the c/c++ dependencies.  Currently this folder is on .gitignore until I am certain about the final plan on how to incorporate zlib into the project.
/nodeApp: This is a folder for nodeJS apps.  With node installed, this can be configured by typing 'npm install'.  Currently there is a minizlib file, but I believe I will try to use the built in node zlib library instead and remove it later.  There is a public folder where I will put some standalone html drafts.  However, I do not intend to install express to host these files as the purpose of using node is to quickly build working code and that's the tool I'm good at.
/src: here's for the main software source folder.
